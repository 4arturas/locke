15. Ideas of primary Qualities are Resemblances; of secondary, not.

From whence I think it easy to draw this observation,â€”that the ideas of primary qualities of bodies are resemblances of them, and their patterns do really exist in the bodies themselves, but the ideas produced in us by these secondary qualities have no resemblance of them at all.

There is nothing like our ideas, existing in the bodies themselves.

They are, in the bodies we denominate from them, only a power to produce those sensations in us: and what is sweet, blue, or warm in idea, is but the certain bulk, figure, and motion of the insensible parts, in the bodies themselves, which we call so.
