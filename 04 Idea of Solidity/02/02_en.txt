2. Solidity fills Space.

This is the idea which belongs to body, whereby we conceive it to fill space.

The idea of which filling of space is,â€”that where we imagine any space taken up by a solid substance, we conceive it so to possess it, that it excludes all other solid substances; and will for ever hinder any other two bodies, that move towards one another in a straight line, from coming to touch one another, unless it removes from between them in a line not parallel to that which they move in.

This idea of it, the bodies which we ordinarily handle sufficiently furnish us with.
