3. The Objects of Sensation one Source of Ideas.

First, our Senses, conversant about particular sensible objects, do convey into the mind several distinct perceptions of things, according to those various ways wherein those objects do affect them. And thus we come by those IDEAS we have of yellow, white, heat, cold, soft, hard, bitter, sweet, and all those which we call sensible qualities; which when I say the senses convey into the mind, I mean, they from external objects convey into the mind what produces there those perceptions.

This great source of most of the ideas we have, depending wholly upon our senses, and derived by them to the understanding, I call SENSATION.
