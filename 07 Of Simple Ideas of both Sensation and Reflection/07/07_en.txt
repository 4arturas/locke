7. Ideas of Existence and Unity.

EXISTENCE and UNITY are two other ideas that are suggested to the understanding by every object without, and every idea within.

When ideas are in our minds, we consider them as being actually there, as well as we consider things to be actually without us; â€” which is, that they exist, or have existence.

And whatever we can consider as one thing, whether a real being or idea, suggests to the understanding the idea of unity.
